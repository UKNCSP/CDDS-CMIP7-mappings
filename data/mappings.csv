The specification of a physical process by the phrase 'due_to_' process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A variable with the standard name tendency_of_air_temperature_due_to_stratiform_cloud_and_precipitation should contain net latent heating effects of all processes which convert stratiform clouds and precipitation between water vapour, liquid or ice phases. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes)."";",,longitude: time: mean where air,zonal mean; hence YZT,latitude plev39 time,mon,Tendency of Air Temperature Due to Stratiform Clouds and Precipitation,atmos,,"CHANGE SINCE CMIP6 in Cell Methods - CMIP6:longitude: mean time: mean CMIP7:longitude: time: mean where air,",GLB,K s-1,CMIP6 CMOR variable,(m01s03i181[lbproc=0] - m01s03i189[lbproc=0] + m01s04i141[lbproc=0] + m01s04i181[lbproc=0] + m01s16i161[lbproc=0] + m01s16i181[lbproc=0] + m01s01i181[lbproc=0] - m01s01i161[lbproc=0] + m01s02i181[lbproc=0] - m01s02i161[lbproc=0] + m01s05i181[lbproc=0] - m01s05i161[lbproc=0]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,(m01s03i181[lbproc=0] - m01s03i189[lbproc=0] + m01s04i141[lbproc=0] + m01s04i181[lbproc=0] + m01s16i161[lbproc=0] + m01s16i181[lbproc=0] + m01s01i181[lbproc=0] - m01s01i161[lbproc=0] + m01s02i181[lbproc=0] - m01s02i161[lbproc=0] + m01s05i181[lbproc=0] - m01s05i161[lbproc=0]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,,(m01s03i181[lbproc=0] - m01s03i189[lbproc=0] + m01s04i141[lbproc=0] + m01s04i181[lbproc=0] + m01s16i161[lbproc=0] + m01s16i181[lbproc=0] + m01s01i181[lbproc=0] - m01s01i161[lbproc=0] + m01s02i181[lbproc=0] - m01s02i161[lbproc=0] + m01s05i181[lbproc=0] - m01s05i161[lbproc=0]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,(m01s03i181[lbproc=0] - m01s03i189[lbproc=0] + m01s04i141[lbproc=0] + m01s04i181[lbproc=0] + m01s16i161[lbproc=0] + m01s16i181[lbproc=0] + m01s01i181[lbproc=0] - m01s01i161[lbproc=0] + m01s02i181[lbproc=0] - m01s02i161[lbproc=0] + m01s05i181[lbproc=0] - m01s05i161[lbproc=0]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,,,K s-1,,

The specification of a physical process by the phrase ""due_to_"" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A variable with the standard name of tendency_of_specific_humidity_due_to_stratiform_cloud_and_precipitation should contain the effects of all processes which convert stratiform clouds and precipitation to or from water vapor. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).",longitude latitude alevel time,mon,Tendency of Specific Humidity Due to Stratiform Clouds and Precipitation,atmos,,,GLB,s-1,CMIP6 CMOR variable,(m01s01i182[lbproc=128] + m01s02i182[lbproc=128] + m01s03i182[lbproc=128] - m01s03i190[lbproc=128] + m01s04i142[lbproc=128] + m01s04i182[lbproc=128] + m01s05i182[lbproc=128] - m01s05i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i182[lbproc=128]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,(m01s01i182[lbproc=128] + m01s02i182[lbproc=128] + m01s03i182[lbproc=128] - m01s03i190[lbproc=128] + m01s04i142[lbproc=128] + m01s04i182[lbproc=128] + m01s05i182[lbproc=128] - m01s05i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i182[lbproc=128]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,,(m01s01i182[lbproc=128] + m01s02i182[lbproc=128] + m01s03i182[lbproc=128] - m01s03i190[lbproc=128] + m01s04i142[lbproc=128] + m01s04i182[lbproc=128] + m01s05i182[lbproc=128] - m01s05i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i182[lbproc=128]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,(m01s01i182[lbproc=128] + m01s02i182[lbproc=128] + m01s03i182[lbproc=128] - m01s03i190[lbproc=128] + m01s04i142[lbproc=128] + m01s04i182[lbproc=128] + m01s05i182[lbproc=128] - m01s05i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i162[lbproc=128] + m01s16i182[lbproc=128]) / ATMOS_TIMESTEP,,,s-1,,
